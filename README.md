# ElecFlashcards
A simple program to create and use flashcards

I never ended up using the program much, so it probably has some strange bugs I never encountered. I never added a feature to edit already existing flashcard files, but since it stores all of its flashcards as text files they should be easy to edit yourself. the files follow this format

//start

hint 1
answer 1

hint 2 
answer 2
the answer can me multiple lines long as long as their isnt a gap between successive lines, as thats how it seperates the questions. (this would be counted as part of answer 2)

END
//end

Make sure to have the newline at the top of the file and the "END" at the end of the file or it won't work properly.
